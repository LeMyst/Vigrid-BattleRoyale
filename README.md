## Hello Survivors! 

After the initial pre-alpha playtest, DayZ Battle Royale was delayed until a framework for DayZ Standalone was built that handled all of the very difficult tasks that would have taken a very long time to build ourselves.  Thankfully, [DayZ Expansion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2116151222) has finally released! This solves so many issues that it really isn't worth describing in detail. What it does mean is that DayZ BR is back under development. 

## DZEBR Branch

This branch contains all of the in-development files for the initial release of **DayZ Battle Royale**. 
> **Note:** The **Master Branch** still contains the original DayZ BR Pre-Alpha files.

##  Download
DayZ BR is not available for download in a packed state at this time. Beta Testing will be done through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/apfw8J).  

## Server Setup

Private servers are recommended at the moment. When information is available for private server hosting, it will be found on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/apfw8J).

## Client Setup

When DayZ BR is available, Beta testers will be given all of the information to install and run DayZ BR. If you are a Beta tester, you can find this information on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/apfw8J).
