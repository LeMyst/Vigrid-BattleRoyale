# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A DayZ Standalone mod (Bohemia Interactive Enfusion engine) implementing battle-royale gameplay, written in **EnfusionScript** (`.c` files). Originally by Kegan, maintained by Myst. Version `0.1.0-Vigrid`, defined in `Scripts/Client/2_GameLib/BattleRoyaleConstants.c` and mirrored in `mod.cpp`.

Hard dependencies (mod load order set in `Workbench/project.cfg`): [CF](https://github.com/Arkensor/DayZ-CommunityFramework), [Dabs Framework](https://github.com/InclementDab/DayZ-Dabs-Framework), [Community-Online-Tools](https://github.com/Jacob-Mango/DayZ-CommunityOnlineTools), [DayZ-Expansion](https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts). `Scripts/Client/config.cpp` requires `DayZExpansion_Scripts`. Each link is the mod's source repository — consult it for a dependency's API rather than guessing.

## Workflow

**Always work in a git worktree.** Before the first edit for any new feature or fix, call the `EnterWorktree` tool — it creates a branch plus a worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` and switches the session into it. Never commit directly to `main`.

- Skip it for read-only work: answering questions, searching, reading logs.
- Skip it if the session is already inside `.claude/worktrees/` — worktrees do not nest.
- **Building from a worktree needs an extra step.** `Deploy.bat` builds whatever `P:\Vigrid-BattleRoyale\` points at, which is the primary checkout (see `SetupMod.bat` below). To build worktree code, re-point that junction at the worktree, or merge back to the primary checkout first — otherwise the build silently packs the old sources. Building the primary checkout never picks up worktree sources: the build skips dot-prefixed folders (see `_EnumPaths.bat`), so `.claude/worktrees/` is invisible to it. Re-pointing the junction still works — `dir` reports paths through the junction, so no dot appears in them.
- Finish the work with a commit on the worktree branch; push and open a draft PR when the change should go to the remote.

## Build & run

Windows-only. Requires DayZ Tools (Steam) and a mounted `P:\` work drive.

**One-time setup:**
1. Copy `Workbench/user_sample.cfg` → `Workbench/user.cfg` and fill in `WorkDrive`, `ModBuildDirectory`, `KeyDirectory`, `KeyName`, `GameDirectory`, `ServerDirectory`, `SPMission`, `MPMission`, profile dirs, SteamIDs. `user.cfg` is gitignored and its values override `project.cfg`.
2. `Workbench/Batchfiles/SetupMod.bat` — creates the `P:\Vigrid-BattleRoyale\` junction into this checkout. The checkout folder name must equal `PrefixLinkRoot` (`Vigrid-BattleRoyale`).

**All batch files must be run with cwd = `Workbench/Batchfiles`** — several `call` siblings by relative path.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Deploy.bat` | Build. Thin wrapper over `CI.bat` → `CI_Build.bat` → `CI1.bat`. Binarize + rapify + pack + sign into `%ModBuildDirectory%@Vigrid-BattleRoyale\`. 2-5 min. |
| `Deploy.bat rebuildAll` | Wipe the output mod folder and rebuild everything. |
| `LaunchOffline.bat` | Single-player with `SPMission`. |
| `LaunchServer.bat` | Dedicated server (clears logs + `storage_*` first). |
| `LaunchLocalMP.bat [1\|2\|3]` | Server + N local clients. `LaunchLocalMP2.bat` / `MP3.bat` are wrappers for `2` / `3`. |
| `LaunchClient.bat [A\|B\|C]` | One client connecting to `127.0.0.1`. `LaunchClientB.bat` / `C.bat` are wrappers for `B` / `C`. |
| `KillGame.bat` | Kill all DayZ/Diag processes. |
| `ClearLogs.bat ["<dir>"]` | Clear **game** logs (`.rpt`, `.ADM`, `.mdmp`) from one profile dir, or all of them when called with no argument — not build logs. |
| `ClearStorage.bat` | Delete `storage_*` under `MPMission`. |

Build result: `Workbench/Logs/Build.log`, plus marker files `Build.success` / `Build.failure` / `Build.deploy`. `CI.bat` hard-fails if `P:\` is not mounted.

**Shared helpers** (`_`-prefixed, not entry points). Everything else calls these instead of re-implementing them:

| Helper | Role |
|---|---|
| `_Config.bat <tag>` | The **only** way config is loaded. Transliterates `project.cfg` then `user.cfg` into `Workbench/combined.cfg.<tag>.bat` (`set "K=V"` per line, `#` and `;` comments skipped) and calls it. `user.cfg` wins by load order. The `<tag>` keeps concurrent callers off each other's artifact. |
| `_Require.bat <Key>` | Echo a config value; non-zero exit if empty. |
| `_EnumPaths.bat <pattern> <outputFile>` | The **only** way the build enumerates sources. Recursive `dir /B /S` from the caller's cwd, minus every path containing a dot-prefixed folder (`.claude`, `.git`, `.idea`, …). Exits 0 when nothing matches. |
| `_SafeDir.bat <path>` | Gate in front of every recursive delete. Normalises the path and exports it as `%brSafeDir%`. Exit `0` safe, `1` unsafe — a drive root, UNC, bare `X:`, leading `\`, or an exact match on a system dir like `%USERPROFILE%` — `2` well-formed but absent (caller skips quietly). Used by `ClearLogs.bat` / `ClearStorage.bat`, whose paths come from the gitignored `user.cfg`. |
| `_LaunchClient.bat <A\|B\|C>` | Resolve the slot's `Player[B\|C]SteamID` / `Player[B\|C]Name` / `Client[B\|C]ProfileDirectory` and start it. |
| `_LaunchServer.bat <SteamID>` | Clear logs + storage, then start the dedicated server. |
| `SetupLaunch.bat <MP\|SP>` | Preamble for every `Launch*.bat`: config, validation, mod list, kill running game. Deliberately no `setlocal` — it exports into the caller. |

Each `config.cpp` with no ancestor `config.cpp` becomes one PBO — currently 8 mod PBOs (`Data`, `GUI`, `LanguageCore`, `Models_Shapes`, `Sounds`, `Scripts_Client`, `Scripts_Server`, `Party`) plus 12 `Extra_*`. Renaming a top-level folder renames its PBO.

## Testing

**There are no tests, no linter, and no CI.** `.github/` contains only `copilot-instructions.md`.

Validation loop: `Deploy.bat` → launch (`ClientEXE` defaults to `DayZDiag_x64.exe`) → read the `.rpt` in the profile directory for script errors.

Runtime log verbosity (one at a time): `-br-warn`, `-br-info`, `-br-debug`, `-br-trace`, `-br-none`. On a server, `serverDZ.cfg` key `BRLogLevel` (1-4, negative disables) does the same. Diag builds default to trace via `#ifdef DIAG` → `BR_TRACE_ENABLED` in `BattleRoyaleConstants.c:10-20`.

Log with `BattleRoyaleUtils.Error/Warn/Info/Debug/Trace(string)` (`Scripts/Client/3_Game/BattleRoyaleUtils.c`) — not `Print`. On server+DIAG these mirror into in-game chat via the `ChatLog` RPC.

## EnfusionScript constraints

- **No ternary operator.** Use `if`/`else`.
- **No multi-line `if` conditions** — the whole condition must be on one line.
- **One declaration per variable name per method scope**, even across disjoint branches.
- `modded class X` extends an existing class; `override` is required to replace a method.

## Architecture

### Script modules and the Client/Server split

The engine compiles in fixed stages: `1_Core → 2_GameLib → 3_Game → 4_World → 5_Mission`. `config.cpp` maps a folder to a stage via `class defs { class <stage>ScriptModule { files[] = {...} } }`. Files are registered **by directory**, so adding a new `.c` file needs no config change; adding a new stage folder does.

**`Scripts/Client` vs `Scripts/Server` is not a runtime split.** Both PBOs ship in the same mod and load on both sides. What actually gates execution is the preprocessor guard on line 1 of each file:

- `Scripts/Server/**` — every file opens with `#ifdef SERVER`.
- `Scripts/Client/**` — `#ifndef SERVER` for client-only, **or no guard at all** for shared code that compiles on both sides (e.g. `BattleRoyaleConstants.c`, `BattleRoyaleUtils.c`, `BattleRoyaleBase.c`, `MissionBaseWorld.c`, `BattleRoyalePlayArea.c`).

When adding a file, pick the folder for organisation and **always add the right guard.** An unguarded file under `Scripts/Client/` runs on the server too.

`BattleRoyale_Scripts_Server` lists `BattleRoyale_Scripts_Client` in `requiredAddons`, so server files compile *after* client files in every stage — that ordering is what lets server code `modded class` over client-declared classes.

Compile-time feature flags live in `Scripts/Client/config.cpp:36-43` (`defines[]`). Only `DAYZ_BATTLEROYALE` is active; `BLUE_ZONE`, `BR_MINIMAP`, `MOVING_ZONE`, `BR_TRACE_ENABLED` are commented out but gate real code. Other `#ifdef`s in use: `SERVER`, `DIAG`, `VIGRID_PARTY` (the in-repo party addon, see below), `JM_COT`, `VPPADMINTOOLS`, `EXPANSIONMODMISSIONS`.

### Entry points

`MissionBaseWorld` (`Scripts/Client/4_World/MissionBaseWorld.c`) holds `ref BattleRoyaleBase m_BattleRoyale`, and the free function **`GetBR()`** in the same file is how any code reaches it on either side.

- Server: `BattleRoyaleServer` (`Scripts/Server/5_Mission/BattleRoyale/Server/BattleRoyaleServer.c`), constructed in `MissionServer.OnInit()`, ticked from `MissionServer.OnUpdate`. Also `BattleRoyaleServer.GetInstance()`.
- Client: `BattleRoyaleClient` (`Scripts/Client/5_Mission/BattleRoyale/Client/BattleRoyaleClient.c`), constructed in `MissionGameplay.OnInit()`, ticked from `MissionGameplay.OnUpdate`.

### Match state machine (server)

States are an **ordered `array<ref BattleRoyaleState>`** built in `BattleRoyaleServer.Init()` (`BattleRoyaleServer.c:88-133`). There is no state enum — the numeric filename prefix in `Scripts/Server/5_Mission/BattleRoyale/Server/States/` encodes the order:

`1_BattleRoyaleDebug` (lobby / ready-up) → `2_BattleRoyaleCountReached` (countdown, lock server) → `3_BattleRoyaleSpawnSelection` (only if `enable_spawn_selection_menu`) → `4_BattleRoyalePrepare` (loadout + teleport) → `5_BattleRoyaleStartMatch` (warmup) → `6_BattleRoyaleRound` × `num_zones` → `7_BattleRoyaleLastRound` → `8_BattleRoyaleWin` → `9_BattleRoyaleRestart` (`RequestExit`). A match is one-shot; the server process restarts between matches.

**The completion protocol is inverted.** `BattleRoyaleState.IsComplete()` returns `!IsActive()` (`0_BattleRoyaleState.c:85-92`), so a state signals "done" by calling **`Deactivate()`** on itself — typically from a timer callback, or from an overridden `IsComplete()` that tests its condition, calls `Deactivate()`, then `return super.IsComplete()`.

`BattleRoyaleServer.Update()` is the only driver: it `Update()`s every state each frame and checks `IsComplete()` at 10 Hz, then deactivates → migrates the player list → activates the next non-skipped state (`SkipState()` lets a state opt out entirely; rounds use it for the dynamic starting zone).

`BattleRoyaleState` extends `Timeable` (`Scripts/Server/3_Game/Logic/Timeable.c`) — use `AddTimer(duration, this, "MethodName", params, looping)`; looping timers are stopped automatically by `Deactivate()`.

Long-running work uses script coroutines — `GetGame().GameScript.Call(this, "MethodName", NULL)` plus `Sleep()` (see `4_BattleRoyalePrepare.ProcessPlayers`), not the call queue.

### Zones

`BattleRoyaleZone` (server, `BattleRoyaleZone.c`) is a static registry; all play areas are generated **once per process** into `static ref array<ref BattleRoyalePlayArea> m_PlayAreas`, largest first. **Zone 1 is the largest** and the last zone is the smallest — `BattleRoyaleZone.c:71` indexes with `i_NumRounds - GetZoneNumber()`. Radii come from `zone_settings.json` `static_sizes`; the other `shrink_type` values are declared but marked unused.

Within a round, the new circle only becomes the damaging boundary at 80% of the round timer (`LockNewZone`); before that `GetActiveZone()` returns the previous zone. Damage is applied per player from `PlayerBase.OnScheduledTick` → `BattleRoyaleServer.OnPlayerTick` → `GetCurrentState().OnPlayerTick`, scaled by zone index.

`BattleRoyaleZone.OnActivate(array<PlayerBase>)` is an intentionally empty hook for player-count-driven zone sizing.

### Networking

Primary channel is **CF's `GetRPCManager()`** with string-named RPCs in two namespaces (`BattleRoyaleConstants.c:37-38`):

- `RPC_DAYZBR_NAMESPACE` (`"RPC-DayZBR"`) — server → client
- `RPC_DAYZBRSERVER_NAMESPACE` (`"RPC-DayZBR-Server"`) — client → server

```c
// register (ctor)
GetRPCManager().AddRPC( RPC_DAYZBR_NAMESPACE, "UpdateCurrentPlayArea", this );

// handler signature is always this
void UpdateCurrentPlayArea(CallType type, ParamsReadContext ctx, PlayerIdentity sender, Object target)

// send: (namespace, name, params, guaranteed, [identity], [target])
GetRPCManager().SendRPC( RPC_DAYZBR_NAMESPACE, "ShowWinScreen", NULL, true, player.GetIdentity() );
```

**Match state is never sent as a state id.** The server pushes discrete facts (`StartMatch`, `SetPlayerCount`, `SetCountdownSeconds`, `UpdateCurrentPlayArea`, `UpdateFuturePlayArea`, `SetFade`, `SetInput`, `SetTopPosition`, …). Each lands as a plain field on the client singleton **`BattleRoyaleRPC`** (`Scripts/Client/3_Game/BattleRoyale/RPC/BattleRoyaleRPC.c`), and `BattleRoyaleClient.Update()` polls those fields every frame, diffing against `br_previous_*` locals to detect edges.

Two secondary channels: `ScriptRPC` with the `BattleRoyaleCOTStateMachineRPC` enum (`Scripts/Client/2_GameLib/BattleRoyaleEnums.c`) for the COT admin module, and sync juncture id `88` for teleports (`Scripts/Server/4_World/Entities/ManBase/PlayerBase.c`).

### Settings (JSON)

Server-side only (`Scripts/Server/3_Game/Config/`, all `#ifdef SERVER`). `BattleRoyaleConfig` is a singleton holding `map<string, ref BattleRoyaleDataBase>`; reach it with `BattleRoyaleConfig.GetConfig().GetGameData()` etc.

| File in `$profile:Vigrid-BattleRoyale\` | Class | Registry key |
|---|---|---|
| `general_settings.json` | `BattleRoyaleGameData` | `GameData` |
| `lobby_settings.json` | `BattleRoyaleLobbyData` | `DebugData` |
| `spawns_settings.json` | `BattleRoyaleSpawnsData` | `SpawnsData` |
| `zone_settings.json` | `BattleRoyaleZoneData` | `ZoneData` |
| `pois_settings.json` | `BattleRoyalePOIsData` | `POIsData` |
| `server_settings.json` | `BattleRoyaleServerData` | `ServerData` — **no mission override** |

The mission override (`$mission:Vigrid-BattleRoyale\`) is **not a merge** — `JsonFileLoader<T>.LoadFile()` is called twice into the same instance (`Load()` then `LoadMission()`), so only keys present in the mission JSON get overwritten. `Upgrade()` runs inside `Load()`, before the mission pass, and `Save()` only ever writes the profile path.

Each class carries `int version` plus an `Upgrade()` migration. `Load()` re-saves after reading, so new fields appear in existing profile JSONs on next boot.

### Parties (`Party/`)

Teams used to come from the third-party `@Carim` mod through 18 `#ifdef Carim` blocks. They now come from **`Party/`**, a top-level folder in this repo that builds into its own `party.pbo` (prefix `Vigrid-BattleRoyale\Party`) and defines `VIGRID_PARTY`.

**`Party/` must not reference any `BattleRoyale*` symbol.** That is why it carries its own logger (`VigridPartyLog`), its own JSON settings loader, its own `stringtable.csv` (`STR_PARTY_*` keys), its own `Data/Inputs.xml` and its own `$profile:Vigrid-Party\` folder. The rule keeps a later extraction into a standalone `@Vigrid-Party` mod a build-plumbing job rather than a rewrite, and it keeps renaming `Party/config.cpp` → `config.cpp.disabled` working as a one-rename kill switch.

The Battle Royale mod talks to it **only** through `VigridPartyAPI` (`Party/Scripts/4_World/VigridPartyAPI.c`), and every call site is wrapped in `#ifdef VIGRID_PARTY` so the mod still builds with the addon disabled:

```c
#ifdef VIGRID_PARTY
    int groups = VigridPartyAPI.GetGroupCount( GetPlayers() );
#endif
```

- Grouping queries take the population explicitly (`GetGroupCount`, `GetGroups`, `GetTeammates`), so Party never needs to know about match state. `GetGroups()` is a **partition**: solo players come back as groups of one, which is what lets most call sites drop their non-party branch entirely.
- Identity is `PlayerIdentity.GetPlainId()` (SteamID64) throughout — never `GetPlayerId()`, a session index the engine reuses after a disconnect. Note `MissionServer.PlayerDisconnected` is handed `GetId()` (hashed), so the manager keeps a `GetId()` → `GetPlainId()` table.
- `VigridPartyAPI.SetFormationLocked(true)` is called from `1_BattleRoyaleDebug.Deactivate()`. While locked, every composition change is refused — otherwise a player leaving mid-match would raise the group count and stall the round-end condition.
- Files: `$profile:Vigrid-Party\party_settings.json` and `parties.json`. Parties are persisted because the server process restarts between matches.
- RPC namespaces `RPC-VigridParty` / `RPC-VigridParty-Server`, message names `VP_*`. CF's `AddRPC` dispatches by **method name**, so a handler method must be named exactly like its registered string.
- Keybind `UAVigridPartyMenu` (P) lives in `Party/Data/Inputs.xml`, declared by a second `inputs=` in `Party/config.cpp`. Read it with `GetUApi().GetInputByName(...)`, not the generated constant.

### Localization

`LanguageCore/stringtable.csv`, keys prefixed `STR_BR_`. The `Party/` addon carries its own `stringtable.csv` at its PBO root with `STR_PARTY_*` keys — the engine loads one per addon — so party strings do not go here. Three reference styles:
- Layouts: `text "#STR_BR_..."`
- Client script: `SetText("#STR_BR_...")`
- **Server script: the bare key with no `#`.** `MessagePlayerUntranslated()` / `MessagePlayersUntranslated()` (`0_BattleRoyaleState.c:200-242`) ship the key over the `NotificationMessage` RPC and the client localizes it in `BattleRoyaleRPC.NotificationMessage()`, which also substitutes the `READY_KEY` / `UNSTUCK_KEY` placeholders with live keybinds.

### UI

Layouts live in `GUI/layouts/`. The dominant pattern is imperative — `GetGame().GetWorkspace().CreateWidgets("Vigrid-BattleRoyale/GUI/layouts/....layout")` then `FindAnyWidget("Name")`; most layouts have no `scriptclass`. `SpawnSelectionMenu` is a `UIScriptedMenu` (`MENU_SPAWN_SELECTION = 75` in `Scripts/Client/3_Game/Constants.c`, instantiated in `MissionBase.CreateScriptedMenu`). The only declarative `scriptclass` binding is the COT `master_controls.layout` → `BRMasterControlsForm`.

Keybinds are declared in `Data/Inputs.xml` (`UADayZBRReadyUp` = F1, `UADayZBRUnstuck` = F2, `UADayZBRDebug` = F3), registered via `inputs = "Vigrid-BattleRoyale/Data/Inputs.xml"` in `Scripts/Client/config.cpp`.

### Kill feed (`Extra/KillFeed/`)

A standalone addon replacing the third-party `nulledkillfeed.pbo`. It builds into `extra_killfeed.pbo` and defines `KILLFEED`. It hooks vanilla `PlayerBase.EEKilled` itself, so it works on any DayZ server — Battle Royale is not required.

**Same discipline rule as `Party/`: nothing under `Extra/KillFeed/` may reference a `BattleRoyale*` symbol.** It carries its own logger (`KillFeedLog`), settings (`$profile:KillFeed\killfeed_settings.json`), `stringtable.csv` (`STR_KF_*`), layouts and RPC namespace (`RPC-KillFeed`). `KILLFEED_PREFIX` in `KillFeedConstants.c` is the single place the asset path appears.

The Battle Royale mod talks to it **only** through `KillFeedAPI` (`Extra/KillFeed/Scripts/4_World/KillFeedAPI.c`), five call sites, each wrapped in `#ifdef KILLFEED`:

```c
#ifdef KILLFEED
    KillFeedAPI.NoteEnvironmentalDamage( player, KillFeedCause.ZONE );
#endif
```

- `SetActive(bool)` — the feed is off in the lobby (`1_BattleRoyaleDebug`), on from `5_BattleRoyaleStartMatch`, off again at `8_BattleRoyaleWin`.
- `NoteEnvironmentalDamage(player, cause)` — called at both `DecreaseHealthCoef` zone-damage sites (`6_BattleRoyaleRound`, `7_BattleRoyaleLastRound`). Scripted damage reaches `EEKilled` with the victim as their own killer, so without this hint a zone death is indistinguishable from starvation. Hints expire after `KILLFEED_HINT_TTL_MS` and are consumed by the death that uses them.

A row renders the killer's weapon **with its attachments** by spawning a client-local `ECE_LOCAL` copy, re-attaching the accessory classnames the server sent, and handing it to an `ItemPreviewWidget` — the same mechanism as the vanilla quickbar. At most `KILLFEED_MAX_ROWS` preview entities exist at once; each is `Delete()`d when its row expires.

Note `$profile:KillFeed\` is also used by NulledKillfeed (`Settings.json`). The filenames differ, so they coexist, but deleting the folder to remove one wipes the other.

### Vigrid API / webhooks

`Scripts/Server/3_Game/BattleRoyale/Webhook/` — REST via `GetRestApi().GetRestContext(BATTLEROYALE_API_ENDPOINT)`. Every call site is gated on `BattleRoyaleConfig.GetConfig().GetServerData().enable_vigrid_api`; `use_autolock` is a separate, independent gate that is *not* covered by it. Each webhook pairs with a `RestCallback` subclass that retries from `i_TryLeft`.

Client-side matchmaking is `MatchMakingWebhook` (`Scripts/Client/3_Game/BattleRoyale/Webhook/`), used by the modded `MainMenu`.

## Asset paths

Script and JSON references use the PBO-relative form with forward slashes: `Vigrid-BattleRoyale/GUI/layouts/...`. `config.cpp` `samples[]` uses backslashes with a leading slash. Profile/mission paths use `$profile:` / `$mission:` with **escaped** backslashes (`"$profile:Vigrid-BattleRoyale\\"`). The prefix comes from `PrefixLinkRoot` in `Workbench/project.cfg`.

Note the imageset's internal name is `battleroyale_gui`, not the filename `dayzbr_gui` — hence `"set:battleroyale_gui image:..."`.

## Adding things

- **A gameplay phase** — subclass `BattleRoyaleState` in `States/` with the next numeric prefix, override `GetName`/`Activate`/`Deactivate`/`IsComplete`/`OnPlayerTick`, and insert it at the right index in `BattleRoyaleServer.Init()`.
- **A field in an existing settings file** — add the member to the data class, bump `version`, add an `Upgrade()` branch if migration is needed. Nothing else.
- **A whole new settings file** — new `BattleRoyaleDataBase` subclass + one `m_Configs.Insert()` in `BattleRoyaleConfig.Init()` (marked `//--- adding a new config? copy below`) + a typed accessor.
- **A server → client value** — field + handler + `AddRPC` in the `BattleRoyaleRPC` ctor + a line in its `Reset()`, then read it from `BattleRoyaleClient.Update()`.
- **A client → server command** — `AddRPC` in the `BattleRoyaleServer` ctor, or in a state's `Activate()` paired with `RemoveRPC` in `Deactivate()`.
- **A standalone tweak** — new folder under `Extra/` with its own `config.cpp` and `Scripts/<stage>/`; it becomes its own PBO. Rename `config.cpp` → `config.cpp.disabled` to exclude it from the build (see `Extra/DisableFogChernarusPlus/`).

## Notes

- `Extra/` holds 13 independent single-purpose sub-addons, each its own PBO, all built unconditionally. All are small script tweaks except `Extra/KillFeed/`, a self-contained addon documented under *Architecture → Kill feed*.
- `Extra/RandomMenuGear/` re-dresses the main-menu intro character in a random outfit plus a slung rifle and a melee weapon, re-rolled on every menu show. It hooks vanilla `IntroSceneCharacter.CreateNewCharacterById` (creation, prev/next arrows) and `MainMenu.OnShow` (returning from a submenu — that path calls `OnChangeCharacter(false)` and never recreates the character). It is **not** a fix for the broken character save that makes the menu character render naked; it only decorates the spawned object. Gear is applied with `GameInventory.CreateAttachmentEx` and deliberately never written into `MenuDefaultCharacterData` — that map is serialized to the server on connect and saved locally, so writing to it would leak menu gear into the real spawn loadout. Same discipline rule as `Party/` and `Extra/KillFeed/`: no `BattleRoyale*` symbol may be referenced.
- Spectating is not implemented — `GUI/layouts/hud/spectator/player.layout` exists but nothing references it. Death shows a screen, then forces disconnect.
- `Workbench/version` (`0.8.100368`) is a DayZ build number read by nothing. The mod version is `BATTLEROYALE_VERSION`.
